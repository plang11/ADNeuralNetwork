# AD Neural Network from Scratch

## Instructions

* Download zip file of this repository to your computer
* Unzip
* In the **Code** folder open the **AD Neural Network.Rmd** file 
* Please ensure you maintain the folder structure to avoid issues with importing data

## Additional Information

We encourage you to explore the following 

* Re-do the model by splitting the data into training and validation, e.g. split data based on country 
* Play around with data preprocessing
     * Change how race or ethnicity is capture 
     * Better ways to normalize the data 
* Find ways to improve the model performance, you can try the following  
     * Change the number of layers and neuron 
     * Activations  

For any questions with the data or code, please use the **Issues** section 

## Raw Data 
* You can request the raw data using C-Path's CODR platform https://codr.c-path.org/main/applyDatabaseSelection.html 


**Enjoy :)**
